# MOLGW 1.F with OpenMP and OpenACC (Single GPU)
------------------------------------------------

Multi-platform shared-memory parallelized MOLGW

## OpenMP (CPU) and OpenACC (GPU) implementations

Hi there,

I implemented OpenMP and OpenACC into MOLGW 1 (https://molgw.org) for CPUs and GPUs, respectively.
I already merged my OpenMP implemenation into MOLGW 2, and I'll merge my OpenACC implementation into MOLGW 3 soon.
For now, the OpenACC version of MOLGW runs only on a single NVIDIA GPU.
Currently, I'm working on a few things:

- A manual for how to compile and run OpenMP and OpenACC versions
- A paper for OpenMP and OpenACC implementations (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/qua.27345)
- Multi-GPU support
- AMD GPU support

Please let me know if you have any questions. :)

Thanks,\
Young-Moo Byun
